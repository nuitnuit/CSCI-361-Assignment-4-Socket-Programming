Please read through this read me file. 

You are required to run the server and client on a linux environment. 
Your router should allow connections on both TCP and UDP for your desired port number. 
Use that port number to host your server when your server prompt you for the port number. 

To get your IP address of the server, simply go to www.whatismyip.com and get the IPv4 address of the server and 
paste it in the client program when the client asks for it. The port number should also follow the client's.
